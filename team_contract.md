## Team Contract
**Team Members** 

Jane Shen, Jenny Chung, Jingran Zhao

**Goals**

Our primary goal is to complete the project to the best of our abilities while maintaining fairness in workload distribution. We aim to produce a high-quality final product that reflects our collective effort and ensures a strong learning experience for all members.

**Work Distribution**

Work will be divided based on strengths, interests, and workload balance, with team discussions ensuring fair distribution. Each member is responsible for completing their assigned tasks to the best of their ability. If a team member struggles with a task, they should communicate with the group early for support, and any necessary adjustments will be discussed openly to maintain equity.

**Group Meetings**

The team will meet at least once a week during lab time and schedule additional meetings as needed. Meetings will focus on dividing tasks for upcoming milestones, aligning on project direction, and addressing any uncertainties. If a member cannot attend, they must notify the team in advance and review meeting notes. Updates will be shared regularly via Slack to keep everyone informed of progress.

**Availability & Communication**

Members are expected to respond to messages within 24 hours on working days. If a team member faces challenges (e.g., workload conflicts, technical difficulties), they should inform the team as soon as possible so a solution can be found together.

**Coding Standards & Version Control**

All code must follow PEP8 style guidelines for Python. Meaningful commit messages should be provided for every GitHub commit. Documentation must be included for all significant features and changes to maintain clarity for the team.

**Decision Making**

Team decisions will be made through discussion and consensus when possible. Major decisions affecting the projectâ€™s direction will be addressed in group meetings, while minor decisions that do not impact the final outcome can be handled asynchronously. If disagreements arise, the team will aim for compromise, with majority agreement guiding the final decision.
