## Motivation and Purpose

## Description of the Data

The dataset used in this project is the [Global Food Prices](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/global-wfp-food-prices) dataset from the World Food Programme, which contains approximately 300,000 records of monthly food prices across 98 developing countries and 3,000 markets from January 1990 to February 2025. Key variables include the date of the record, market location (city with latitude/longitude), food category (e.g., cereals, oils, tubers), specific food item, local currency, price, and price in USD.

To supplement this dataset, we will incorporate the adjusted net national income per capita (US$) from the past ten years, sourced from the [World Development Indicators](https://databank.worldbank.org/source/world-development-indicators). This will allow us to derive a new variable as an indicator of food affordability per country, providing additional context to price trends. Moreover, we will incorporate the prevalence of undernourishment of different countries from the past twenty years, sourced from the [Food and Agriculture Organization](https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/FS).
