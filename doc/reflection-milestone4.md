## Reflection on Our Dashboard

 In this reflection, we explain what we have built so far, what still needs work, and how we have used feedback to improve the app.

### What We Have Implemented

- Header and Layout:
We added a header that clearly shows the dashboardâ€™s title and purpose. This gives users an immediate idea of what the dashboard is about. We also included titles and descriptions for each tab and plot, making it easier for users to follow along.

- Visual Enhancements:
We improved the affordability plot by adding a feature that shows the change compared to the previous year. This helps users see trends over time more clearly. Additionally, we added a legend on the map, which now helps users understand what the colors and symbols represent.

- Detailed Explanations:
Each graph now has a better description to explain what the data means. For example, we clarified the difference between "All Commodities" and "Essential Commodities" in our food price trend plots. This extra detail makes it easier for users to understand the context behind the numbers.


### Feedback and Improvements
Feedback from peers and TAs played an important role in our development process. Here are some key points we addressed:

- Positive Feedback:
Users liked the overall clean design and found the interactive features (like the cursor for comparisons) very helpful. They felt that the dashboard was easy to navigate and the graphs were informative.

- Areas for Improvement:
One of the suggestions was to shorten the variable names to improve readability. Although we made some effort to do this, the variable names have their own meaning that is important to the users. Trying to shorten them too much sometimes led to technical issues, like overlapping text. So, we chose to keep the variable names as they are to avoid confusion.


### What Is Still Under Development

There are still some areas we need to improve:

### Conclusion

Overall, our dashboard now has a strong design with clear titles, descriptions, and visual aids that make the data easier to understand. While we have made significant progress, we recognize there are still improvements to be made. By focusing on the areas that need work and considering user feedback, we are confident that our dashboard will continue to evolve and become even more user-friendly in the future.
