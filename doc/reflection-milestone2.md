# Milestone 2 - Reflection

In this milestone we have prototyped the three most important plots of the conceived dashboard: the map displaying varying commodity prices across the markets within a country, the average commodity prices over time per country, and the share of population that is undernourished over time per country. 

So far, most of the intended functionality for the three plots is implemented, including:
- Separation of plots into Global and Country tabs for different analysis levels
- Shared country dropdown and year range slider used to update both Global plots
- All plots able to update with changes to dropdown selections

Some bugs exist in terms of styling which will be amended by the next Milestone:
- Switching from "All Commodities" to "Essential Commodities" in the Global tab causes the grid layout to change
- Clearing all selections in the Select Country dropdown also causes the grid layout to change

Future developments include:
- Improving styling consistency across tabs and across different states
- Improving interpretability with more titles, subtitles, and context of the dashboard
- Improving visual aesthetic
- Integrating the remaining plots specified in the project proposal
