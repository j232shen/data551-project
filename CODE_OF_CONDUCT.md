# Code of Conduct

Our team is committed to maintaining a respectful, inclusive, and professional working environment. This project should be a space where everyone feels valued and able to contribute effectively.

**Respectful Interaction** 

- Treat all team members with respect, regardless of differences in opinions or working styles.
- Be open to feedback and constructive criticism, and deliver your own feedback in a considerate manner.
- Avoid interrupting or dismissing others' contributionsâ€”every idea is worth consideration.
  
**Inclusive Collaboration**

- Ensure discussions remain welcoming and free from discriminatory or exclusionary language.
- Encourage participation from all team members and make space for quieter voices.
- Acknowledge and appreciate the contributions of others.

**Professionalism**

- Maintain clear and professional communication in all project-related discussions.
- Resolve conflicts through discussion rather than personal attacks or passive-aggressive behavior.
- If an issue escalates, bring it up respectfully and work towards a resolution together.
  
By following these principles, we aim to create a productive and positive working environment where all team members can contribute meaningfully.
